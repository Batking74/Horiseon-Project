# Horiseon-Project

### Description
Established with the primary goal of honing my skills, this project is a dedicated endeavor to practice utilizing HTML semantic tags. Through hands-on engagement with these tags, I aimed to deepen my understanding and proficiency in structuring web content in a semantically meaningful way.

- My motivation for this project was being able to apply the skills I learned to this project.
- I built this project to better my HTML skills and using semantic elements.
- From this project I learned how to properly use HTML semantic elements to make a website more accessible to users, how to use better practices to reduce the amount of code in the codebase, and utilize comments to make my code even more readable for other potential developers.
