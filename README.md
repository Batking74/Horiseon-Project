# Horiseon-Project

### Description

This project was created for me to practice working on using HTML semantic tags.

- My motivation for this project was being able to apply the skills I learned to this project.
- I built this project to better my HTML skills and using semantic elements.
- From this project I learned how to properly use HTML semantic elements to make a website more accessible to users, how to use better practices to reduce the amount of code in the codebase, and utilize comments to make my code even more readable for other potential developers.
